# Testing Hypotheses About Red Wine Dataset

This project focused on investigating hypotheses related to the quality of red wine. It was developed to enhance my skills in data analysis, hypothesis testing, and visualization. The dataset used in this project is Red Wine Quality, available on Kaggle, originally published by UCI Machine Learning.

## About

This notebook explores a dataset containing physicochemical and quality ratings of red wines. The analysis is centered around testing predefined hypotheses to understand factors that most influence wine quality.

---

## Goals

Test hypotheses related to wine quality factors.

Practice data analysis.

Generate insights through statistical analysis and visualization.

## Key Analyses

What Is the Probability That These Samples Are Valid?
Do sulphate levels impact to quality?
What is the influence of pH categories on the quality categories?
Lower Chlorides Have Better Quality
Does homogeneity of variances exist between low and high density?
